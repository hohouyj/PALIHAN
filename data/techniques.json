Jamiyun Kulisa is the burning Brother Thunderbolt, son of the Sky Father Si Gurang Tungko, He Who Holds The Sky Aloft, known sometimes as the Batala or Batara, said to have wrought the creation of Folk. The lightning does not take advice from any one, just as the flame never seeks the comfort of water. Jamiyun Kulisa arises and truly is always there, counterpart to the great Sunmother Indira Suga, who is not his Mother but rather his partner. Together they create the Great Dichotomy within the Sword Isles, the two overpowering Seasons of the Center of the World: the Dry Season of Indira Suga and the Monsoon Season of Jamiyun Kulisa. As Jamiyun Kulisa is the bringer of Monsoon Season, he is also connected to the things that Monsoon Season brings about: rumination, calmness, peace, the soft patter of raindrops, the chill of strong storm winds. He strikes at the heart and cares not: us Mortal Folk have to bend to him when he brings with him his seasons. Upon the Sky he is well acquainted with the Wind Gods: Amihan, the Cold Wind. Habagat the Hot Tempest. Salatan the Cavern Winds. Kanaway the Death Squall. Balahalabagyu, known also as Vayu or Batara Vayu, the God of Storms, who brings destructive hurricanes. Galura, the Great Dragon-Eagle at the End of the World, who is said to be an aspect of Jamiyun Kulisa. \"Are you happy with what you've done?\" asked Makangayaw, grinning, with burning flame shooting out of his nostrils. The Second Man nodded. \"I have lain retribution upon what my sister has cursed upon me.\" \"And what have they cursed upon you?\" \"Jealousy.\" With another mighty laugh, Apung Makangayaw answered: \"And so the cycle begins.\" Apung Makangayaw is offered to whenever a ceremonial raid is enacted, whether it be a raid to gain resources or a revenge raid. In this way, the raid itself becomes more than just war, but ritual. If the omens were bad during the offering, however, it will be a sign that Makangayaw does not approve of the raid, and the raid will be called off. This usually happens when an omen bird flies across their path, or when the sky is red, or when in the distance they hear laughter during their offerings, or when they perform their boat divinations the boat shudders wildly. Offerings to Apung Makangayaw are frequent, for the main mode of war in the islands is raiding. Apung Makangayaw usually takes upon the form of a slave raider: wearing a short bahag with nothing else, and with tattoos that cover their entire body, the completion of the canvas. Their true form, whenever they should want to show it, is in the form of a naga-headed god, who sits upon a throne of seaspray. Apung Makangayaw is one of the principal members of the Anito faith. Anito, meaning act of worship, is the most widespread faith in the islands, so prominent that they do consider it more as tradition and way of life, and not just performative religion. Apung Makangayaw's spirit house is often situated by the shore, always by the shore. The usual spirit idol carved out for him is made usually with wood from sunken boats, and showcases a naga-headed man sitting cross-legged, with both hands upon his waist. Apung Makangayaw idols are frequently carried unto boats that would embark on raids.",

It is important to consider then that these Mahadiwa were once warriors, who all died in war, and thus were made gods by the rainbow that carried them to the Sky. Thus each of the Mahadiwa are capable of human thought, speech, and understanding. They possess the Knowledge of Good and Evil that they used to have when they were humans. When a Mahadiwa dies or is killed, they simply reincarnate as another Mahadiwa. Through this, they live 999,999,999,999 lives. Mahadiwa Tala Kinabanaagan is the Bronze Multiplicitous Sidereal Steward of Stars, who lives in the Morning Star that brings with it the dawn. Mahadiwa's karakoa and coterie of 180 Star Servants Upon Astral Palanquins are said to fly across the sky, pulling the dark blankets of night away and giving it back to the Moon, Tsandira Dayawa. She watches the earth, and guards many secrets to sorcery, as the givers of sorcery are hidden away in the darkest voids of night. Mahadiwa Tala Kinabanaagan is also said to grant Hiyang to those that spend their lives trying to achieve it. Those she grants Hiyang to are given corporeal forms as stars upon the sky. Her being can be seen in the dawn, the dusk, the lightning bolts, the shooting stars, the comets, and the asteroids. She has lived her entire life in enlightenment. It is said that when she died, she was on the cusp of Hiyang, and when she was killed by a Ten- Fathoms Long Lance, she became a star that exploded upon the field, burning all in smokeless flame, and then shot up into the sky as the Evening Star. She is said to have a mirror image: Mahadiwa Kalakatri Duumanun, her darker side, the shadow that wraps around each star at night. They are both all at once the same and also different. The Bulakdiwa say: she is like this because she dared venture into the deepest parts of the night sky, further and further, past the void and the world jaws and the endless seas of chaos. Past the firmament, and past the darkness. The Bulakdiwa say: what she found, apparently, was not God, nor the Throne, nor Enlightenment--for how could she? She is already nature itself--but instead she found that she was swimming up, up, up, and up into the ocean. Her enlightenment is thus: the depths of the ocean and the farthest reaches of the void are one and the same. And when she understood the cyclical nature of reality and metareality, she realized that she lived in a world of unconstrained principles, she realized then that she lived in a world fabricated by dancers and singers and artists singing songs and laughing about a bonfire, and that split her into two, and her enlightenment-beyond-enlightenment was lost. But she still remembers. She knows the kinds of god-beings--many just as powerful as her--living in the Depths|Void. The Evening Star burns continuously. She is an evershining flame. Aba, aba, glory to the Evening Star. In the Eighth Star Era, only she has the sidereal violence to shine into the new world.",
